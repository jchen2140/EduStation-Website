    <p class = "niharikaParagraph"> Welcome to our website! I'm Niharika, a rising Junior located in the Bay Area. Being the first person in my family studying here in the states, I've had to navigate all things high school and college alone. This process is, in one word, difficult. There are a multitude of things to know and do, most of which are unspoken and expected to be known and done. This expectation creates an uneven playing field and prevents many students from being well prepared. Our site is the central place home to the best advice and resources, all freely available, to help students of all backgrounds succeed! </p>
